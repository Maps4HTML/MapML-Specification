<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>Map Markup Language is a text format for encoding map information for the World Wide Web.</p>
  <p>The objective of MapML is to allow Web-based user agent software (browsers and others) to interact with web servers by relying only on publicly defined Web standards (URI, HTTP, this specification), and not on URL recipes/templates, with the goal of displaying modern interactive Web maps.</p>

	

<div id="sotd">
  <h2 id="status">Status of This Document</h2>

  <p class="required"><em>This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document.</em></p>

  <p class="disclaimer required"><strong>Although W3C has provided the template for this document for community use, the document is not affiliated with W3C in any way, and is not endorsed or approved by W3C.</strong></p>

  <p class="required">This document is a draft of this specification, produced by an independent party.  It is inappropriate to cite this specification as as a publication of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), or anything other than a <em>work in progress</em> by an independent entity.</p>
  <p>In particular, certain aspects of this document are yet to be defined.  Feedback from the community is solicited for accessibility and DOM APIs.  Also, it is the intention of the MapML format to be able to serve and represent WMS requests and responses,
  without requiring the client to 'understand' WMS, via the <code>image</code> element.  That element only exists on paper / in the schema at the time of writing.</p>


  <h3>Intent of this Specification</h3>
  
  <p>MapML is needed because while Web browsers implement HTML and SVG, including the <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> element, those implementations do not meet the 
    requirements of the broader Web mapping community.  On the one hand, the semantics of maps are quite different from those of Scalable Vector Graphics,
    while on the other hand, the semantics of the HTML <code>map</code> element are incomplete or insufficient relative to modern Web maps and
    mapping in general.  Robust web maps are implemented by a variety of non-standard technologies.  Web maps do not work without script support, making
    their creation a job beyond the realm of beginners' skill sets, while making them inherently inaccessible.
    
    In order to improve collaboration and integration of the mapping and Web communities, it is desirable to enhance or augment
    the functionality of the &lt;map> element in HTML to include the accessible user interface functions of modern web maps (e.g. panning, zooming, searching for, 
     and zooming to, styling, identifying features’ properties, etc.), while maintaining a simple, declarative, accessible interface for HTML authors.  At the same time, 
     the HTML interface should provide low-level programmable mapping hooks in the style of the Web.  While we're at it, maybe we can improve the state
    of Web mapping by adopting and incorporating the core values of the Web, namely federation by virtue of hyperlinks and standardized media types.</p>
  <p>To achieve this it is necessary to define a new hypertext format (MapML) which encodes map semantics directly.  MapML will provide part of the 
    ‘contract’ between Web user agents and Web servers when map features are exchanged, in a manner based on the architectural style of the Web, 
    in a similar way to how HTML provides (part of) the contract for documents.</p>
  <p>This document is a proposal to the Web and Mapping communities.  The intention is to define a new hypertext format (MapML) which encodes map semantics 
    directly, but which leverages existing standards where possible and desirable, such as Cascading Style Sheets, for example.  MapML will provide an 
    essential part of the contract between Web user agents and Web servers when map features are exchanged, in a manner based on the architectural 
    style of the Web, in a similar way to how HTML provides (part of) the contract for documents.</p>
	
  <h3>Implementation Experience</h3>
  
  <p>MapML has been <a href="#sec-examples">implemented</a> by Natural Resources Canada, which participates in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/">W3C Maps for HTML Community Group</a>.  
    It is hoped that other organizations will also implement MapML and contribute their experience back to the community via the Community Group and <a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/MapML">Github</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Changes Since the Previous Draft</h3>
  
  <p>Added discussion of Tiled Coordinate Reference Systems.  Added CBMTILE coordinate reference system.  Changed name of <code>tile</code> attribute <code>x</code> to
    <code>col</code>.  Changed name of <code>tile</code> attribute <code>y</code> to <code>row</code>.  Changed the <code>extent</code> element to use tiled coordinate
  reference system units, not WGS84 units. </p>

<div id="sec-intro">
	<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>This section is informative.</p>
	
  <p>Map Markup Language is a text-based format which is allows map authors to encode map information as hypertext documents exchanged over the Uniform Interface of the Web.  The format is defined using some characteristics of HTML, MicroXML, GeoJSON and other standards.</p>
	
</div>



<div id="sec-conformance">  
	<h2 id="conformance">2. Conformance</h2>
	<p>This section is normative.</p>
	
  <p><dfn id="conforming-documents">Conforming documents</dfn> are documents that comply with all the conformance criteria for
    MapML documents. For readability, some of these conformance requirements are phrased as conformance
    requirements on authors; such requirements are implicitly requirements on documents: by
    definition, all documents are assumed to have had an author. (In some cases, that author may
    itself be a user agent — such user agents are subject to additional rules, as explained
    below.)</p>
  <p>User agents fall into several (overlapping) categories with different conformance requirements.</p>
  <dl>
    
    <dt id="interactive">Web browsers and other interactive user agents</dt>
    
    <dd>
      <p>Web browsers are one of the primary client technologies anticipated for MapML, however other categories of interactive client could also be developed, for example
      as extensions to / plugins for traditional Geographic Information Systems software.</p>
     
<!--       
      <p class="example">A conforming XHTML processor would, upon finding an XHTML <code><a href="#the-script-element">script</a></code>
        element in an XML document, execute the script contained in that element. However, if the
        element is found within a transformation expressed in XSLT (assuming the user agent also
        supports XSLT), then the processor would instead treat the <code><a href="#the-script-element">script</a></code> element as an
        opaque element that forms part of the transform.</p>
      
      <p>Web browsers that support <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a> must process documents labeled with an
        <a href="#html-mime-type">HTML MIME type</a> as described in this specification, so that users can interact with
        them.</p>
      
      <p class="note">Unless explicitly stated, specifications that override the semantics of HTML
        elements do not override the requirements on DOM objects representing those elements. For
        example, the <code><a href="#the-script-element">script</a></code> element in the example above would still implement the
        <code><a href="#htmlscriptelement">HTMLScriptElement</a></code> interface.</p>
-->      
    </dd>
    
    <dt id="non-interactive">Non-interactive presentation user agents</dt>
    
    <dd>
      
      <p>User agents that process MapML documents purely to render non-interactive versions
        of them must comply to the same conformance criteria as map browsers, except that they are
        exempt from requirements regarding user interaction.</p>
      
      <p>While MapML documents are thought to describe map semantics in a standard way, the scope of
      this specification is intended to not overlap that of HTML documents themselves.  As such, this 
      conformance class may not be relevant, except when consuming MapML within the context of an HTML
      instance's user agent.  For example, the legend and other supporting map related information is out
      of scope for MapML, whereas it is conceivably in-scope for HTML documents.</p>
      
      <p class="note">Typical examples of non-interactive presentation user agents are printers.</p>
      
    </dd>
    
    <dt id="non-scripted">User agents with no scripting support</dt>
    
    <dd>
      
      <p>Scripting can form an integral part of a Web application. User agents that do not
        support scripting, or that have scripting disabled, however should still be able to display and enable
      map-user interaction via the affordances described in this document.</p>
      
    </dd>
    
    
    <dt>Conformance checkers</dt>
    
    <dd id="conformance-checkers">
      
      <p>Conformance checkers must verify that a document conforms to the applicable conformance
        criteria described in this specification.</p>
      
      <p>The term "MapML validator" can be used to refer to a conformance checker that conforms
        to the applicable requirements of this specification.</p>
      
      <div class="note">
        
        <p>Schemas cannot express all the conformance requirements of this specification. Therefore, a
          validating XML processor and a DTD cannot constitute a conformance checker.</p>
        
        <p>To put it another way, there are three types of conformance criteria:</p>
        
        <ol>
          
          <li>Criteria that can be expressed in a schema (RelaxNG, XML Schema etc).</li>
          
          <li>Criteria that cannot be expressed by a DTD, but can still be checked by a machine.</li>
          
          <li>Criteria that can only be checked by a human.</li>
          
        </ol>
        
        <p>A conformance checker must check for the first two. A simple RelaxNG-based validator only checks
          for the first class of errors and is therefore not a conforming conformance checker according
          to this specification.</p>
        
      </div>
    </dd>
    
    
    <dt>Data mining tools</dt>
    
    <dd id="data-mining">
      
      <p>Applications and tools that process HTML and MapML documents for reasons other than to either
        render the documents or check them for conformance should act in accordance with the semantics
        of the documents that they process.</p>
      
    </dd>
    
    
    <dt id="editors">Authoring tools and markup generators</dt>
    
    <dd>
      
      <p>Authoring tools and markup generators must generate <a href="#conforming-documents">conforming documents</a>.
        Conformance criteria that apply to authors also apply to authoring tools, where appropriate.</p>
      
      <p class="example">For example, a markup generator must ensure that polygons have three or more vertices, the first and last of which have the same location.</p>
      
      <p class="note">In terms of conformance checking, an editor has to output documents that conform
        to the same extent that a conformance checker will verify.</p>
      
      <p>When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming document, it may preserve the
        conformance errors in sections of the document that were not edited during the editing session
        (i.e. an editing tool is allowed to round-trip erroneous content). However, an authoring tool
        must not claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so preserved.</p>
      
      <p>Authoring tools are expected to come in two broad varieties: tools that work from structured
        databases, and tools that work on an interactive What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get media-specific editing
        basis (WYSIWYG).</p>
      
      <p>All authoring tools, whether WYSIWYG or not, should make a best effort attempt at enabling
        users to create accessible, well-structured, and efficient content.</p>

  <p>This document contains explicit conformance criteria that overlap with some RNG definitions in requirements. If there is any conflict between the two, the explicit conformance criteria are the definitive reference. </p>

	<h2 id="ucr">3. Use Cases and Requirements</h2>
	<p>This section is informative.</p>
	
	<h3 id="use-cases">3.1. Use Cases</h3>
  <p>The following usage scenarios illustrate some of the ways in which Map Markup Language might be used for various applications:</p>

  <p><strong>Tiled maps</strong>: Modern map services are dominantly created by composing adjacent map 'tiles' (often bitmapped images) into a coherent and unified image of a map.</p>
  <p><strong>Image-based maps</strong>: Web services typically produce a single geo-referenced image which constitutes a map. MapML encodes URL references to such images,
  together with appropriate georeferencing metadata.</p>
  <p><strong>Vector-based maps</strong>: Geospatial databases, for example PostGIS, are able to serve and manipulate vector representations of features which can be symbolized according to their properties. </p>
  <p><strong>Multi-layer maps</strong>: Maps are often required to overlay information in such a way as to enable both visual and automatated spatial relationship processing. 
  MapML will support the layering of information using the 'painters model', wherein elements are drawn in document order overtop of earlier elements, together with CSS styling (transparency) techniques.</p>  
  <p><strong>Use CSS for map styles</strong>: MapML elements should be style-able with CSS rules supplied by the MapML author. 
    For example, the MapML author should be able to link to a stylesheet from a MapML document.</p>
  <p><strong>Location search</strong>: A MapML service might want to allow service consumers to search within the contents of a service for a place name or an address, over which the map is repositioned when a selection is made.  MapML should provide (markup) facilities to enable such searches without forcing the client download large amounts of geospatial data.</p>
  <p><strong>Hyperlinks between and within services</strong>: MapML should allow service-level links such that service providers can link together / federate to provide apparently seamless spatial coverage.</p>
  <p><strong>Feature identification</strong>: If a MapML document includes features, the MapML author should be able to markup any or all of those features in a way which lends itself to
  feature identification and property display.</p>
  <p><strong>Attribution</strong>: MapML documents encode citation information on a per-request basis, making it available as markup in the response.</p>

  <h3 id="requirements">3.2. Requirements</h3>

  <p><strong>Uniform interface</strong>: No URL recipes should be required to be supported by clients - support for simple opaque URLs and standardized media types should be all that is required clients.  Application state / state transitions should be conveyed in markup.</p>
  <p><strong>Implementation commitments</strong>: Simple, lightweight server software should be available to allow authors to serve spatial resources as MapML.</p>
  <p>One or more <strong>accessibile </strong>Custom Element clients should be available to demonstrate client functionality.</p>
  <p><strong>Ease of authoring</strong>:  A range of authoring situations should be supported, from simple single file services to robust MapML services over large volumes of framework data</p>

        <h2 id="features">4. Semantics and structure of MapML documents</h2>
        <p>This section is normative.</p>
        <h3 id="semantics">4.1. Semantics</h3>
        <h4 id="projections">4.1.1 Projections</h4>
        <p>A key factor which enables map "mashups" is the shared common coordinate systems and projections of the data used in the integration. On the modern Web, such interoperability is often achieved by using or assuming the use of de facto standard coordinate systems. Either the data being integrated already shares a common coordinate system, or it some or all of it must be transformed into a common coordinate system prior to being integrated. This approach often works, within the limits of operating assumptions. MapML documents are similar to other spatial information with regard to definition of projection and coordinate system requirements. However, MapML defines a system of communicating projection information across the uniform interface of HTTP in order to eliminate assumptions in shared coordinate systems: the coordinate systems requested by the client and available from the server are represented as simple defined identifiers defined in the table below, and exchanged in markup defined by this specification. </p>

        <p>All coordinate reference systems' coordinate pairs, where not explicitly marked up or identified by axis (for example, in the <code>&lt;coordinates&gt;</code> element) are defined by this specification to be in "x,y" axis order. Where an external conflict of definition exists, this specification must be taken to be correct <strong>for MapML only</strong>. In other words, this specification overrides externally defined axis order for coordinates marked up in Map Markup Language only.
            For coordinate reference systems where an axis might not be readily identifiable as "x" or "y" (for example, axes named "Easting" and "Northing"), this specification defines the mapping
            to the MapML axes.</p>
        <h5 id="OSMTILE">OSMTILE</h5>
        <p>This specification defines the string "OSMTILE" to be the identifier of a tiled coordinate reference system projected (in the Web Mercator system) and scaled
          into 19 zoom levels (0-18) at defined resolutions. The mapping of EPSG::3857 axes to MapML axes is: Easting &#8594; x, Northing &#8594; y.  The origin of the OSMTILE coordinate system 
          <strong>and</strong> tile grid is located at 
          (x = -20037508.342787, y = 20037508.342787) in the Web Mercator projected coordinate system.  The tiles are 256px X 256px in size.
          The OSMTILE coordinate reference system has become a de facto interoperable standard for 'slippy' Web maps, and is not redefined, merely described herein.
          The OSMTILE coordinate reference system is suitable for small scale mapping of the Earth, exclusive of north and south polar latitudes, where distortion is extreme.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the major defining characteristics of the OSMTILE coordinate reference system include the fact that a large portion of the surface of the earth is represented by a 
          single 256px by 256px tile (image) at zoom level 0, with successive zoom levels' tiles dividing the area represented by the parent tile into four equal quadrants, 
          and 'nesting' perfectly within the parent tile such that each sucessive level of tiles contains 2<sup>zoom</sup> individual tiles. The geo-registration of tiles at all 
          zoom levels is defined by the coordinate system definition, and they can thus be 'mashed up' with other spatial data in a defined manner.</p>
        <h5 id="CBMTILE">CBMTILE</h5>
        <p>This specification defines the string "CBMTILE" to be the identifier of a tiled coordinate reference system projected in the Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) system (EPSG::3978), and scaled into 18
        zoom levels (0-17) at defined resolutions.  The mapping of EPSG::3978 axes to MapML axes is: Easting &#8594; x, Northing &#8594; y.  The origin of the CBMTILE coordinate system
        <strong>and</strong> tile grid is located at (x = -34655800, y = 39310000) in the LCC projected coordinate system.  The tiles are 256px X 256px in size.  
        The CBMTILE tiled coordinate reference system is suitable for small to medium scale mapping of Canada.</p>
        <h5 id="APSTILE">APSTILE</h5>
        <p>The APSTILE tiled coordinate reference system is based on the Stereographic family of map projections, with the North polar aspect, per the EPSG::5936 coordinate reference system. This projection system is suitable for displaying
        areas in (north) polar latitudes.</p>
        <h5 id="WGS84">WGS84</h5>
        <p>This specification defines the string "WGS84" to be the identifier of a coordinate reference system defined by the EPSG::4326 geodetic coordinate reference system, 
          <strong>with the mandatory provision that the mapping of EPSG::4326 axes to MapML axes is: Longitude &#8594; x, Latitude &#8594; y.</strong>. 
          This constraint follows the definition of the default coordinate system defintion for the GeoJSON format. This is believed to enhance interoperability, not only with the GeoJSON 
          format, but on the Web.</p>
        <p>Although it is not strictly speaking a "projection", WGS84 is discussed in this specification as a "tiled coordinate reference system" identifier, and is discussed under the projection rubric because of the related
        nature of its use. </p>
        <h5 id="OTHERPROJECTIONS">Other projections</h5>
        <p>Many other projections exist, and could in princple be used by MapML clients and servers. As such projections come into common usage, it is expected that their definitions for use in MapML and on the Web will be imported here. The
        contents of this document constitutes a registry of such projections.</p>
        <h4 id="scale">4.1.2 Scale / Zoom levels</h4>
        <p>Scale is an essential characteristic of all geospatial information. The scale at which information is used dictates the model used for its representation. Geospatial information cannot be meaningfully combined without consideration given to its scale. Entire cities are represented on 'small scale' maps as dots, whereas on another large scale map, a single city could have many thousands of individual features in its depiction.</p>
        <p>Not only is scale important in the portrayal of maps, it is also essential when defining the model of underlying feature data.</p>
        <p>Map projections distort the surface of the earth in ways which suit the objectives of the projection definition. As a result of that distortion, the scale of maps in that projection varies as a function of location. "Zoom" levels are integer values chosen to be a simple numeric proxy for a scale at a defined location. For example, the OSMTILE projection, being based internally on the Spherical Web Mercator projection (EPSG::3857), allows us to portray a large portion of the Earth's surface, requiring relatively simple and fast math to convert to and from WGS84. Additionally, it enables the simple tiling system that has become a de facto standard. As such, it was deemed to have the properties for a globally useful projection on the Web.</p>
        <p>Map documents encoded in MapML have a defined scale, indirectly identified by zoom level and extent. Thus, two MapML documents in the same projection and zoom level should be interoperable to the degree that they can be automatically and visually related. The zoom level of a MapML document is often identified as the value of the <code>value</code> attribute of the <code>input[@type=zoom]</code>. It is anticipated that 'zoom' will be a defined media type parameter of the MapML MIME type. In that case, the zoom level of any MapML document should be present in the <code> meta[http-equiv="Content-Type"]/@content</code> value.</p>
        <h4 id="extent-semantics">4.1.3 Extents</h4>
        <p>A MapML document is a representation of a defined portion of a two dimensional map area. In MapML, this is called an 'extent' (see below), which must be described by the bounding axis values xmin, ymin, xmax and ymax. 
           The bounds of an extent should be specified in MapML projection units, as identified by the <code>extent[@units]</code> value.</p>
        <h4 id="fragments">4.1.4 Fragment identifiers</h4>
        <p>TBD. Thinking of something like bbox={xmin},{ymin},{xmax},{ymax} and (possibly) zoom values, although because a MapML document has a single zoom value, it could likely be omitted.</p>

        <p>The <code>tile</code> element is a type of feature which is associated with a tiled coordinate reference system that subdivides or 'tiles' 2D space in a recursively 
          repeating grid pattern, where the origin of both the tiled coordinate reference system and the grid at all zoom levels is defined in coordinates of an underlying 
          projected coordinate reference system.</p>
        <p>A defining characteristic of tiled coordinate reference systems is that they rely on integer grid row/col coordinates and zoom values.  The use of these values in 
          URLs can yield highly cacheable resources, which can lead to high-performance map services.</p>
        <p>The "zoom" value is a global integer property of a MapML document whose coordinate system is defined by this specification.   All MapML documents have a defined zoom value.
          The "zoom" value is equal to the <code>zoom@value</code> child of the <code>extent</code> element.  Hence the zoom value is not a direct 
        attribute of the <code>tile</code> element.</p>
        <p>The main example of such a tiled coordinate reference system is <a href="#OSMTILE"><code>OSMTILE</code></a>, although others exist.</p>

          <p id="position">In MapML, features have positions in 2D space.  A position is sometimes marked up with coordinate data explicitly identified by axis, for example in the
            <a href="#the-tile-element"><code>tile</code></a> element, the attributes <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are used.  Equally common is coordinate data which 
            omits explicit markup of positions' axes, for example in the <code>coordinates</code> element.  
            In the <code>coordinates</code> element, positions must be encoded in <code>x</code>,<code>y</code> order, separated by whitespace.  The <code>coordinates</code> element
          is used to model the content of various geometries in MapML.  Its content and the meaning of its content it depends on what geometry value it is used in.  The 
          context and content of the <code>coordinates</code> element is described in the <a href="#the-geometry-element"><code>geometry</code> element table</a>.  A RelaxNG
            schema for MapML is provided below, however schema validation is not able to fully validate the context and content of the <code>coordinates</code> element.  Such 
          requirements are listed under the column "Non-schema constraints"</p>
        <p>The positions in the <code>coordinates</code> element define the location of the feature.  For <code>geometry</code> elements whose value is ,
          <code>LineString</code>, <code>MultiPoint</code> or <code>MultiLineString</code>, this specification neither assigns nor requires special ordering or other constraints, apart from
          the axis order described above.  For <code>geometry></code> elements whose value is a <code>Polygon</code> or <code>MultiPolygon</code> element,  the descendant 
          <code>coordinates</code> elements must follow additional constraints.</p>
